Symbol table
- implemented using 30 buckets and a hash function that maps any string to one of the 30 buckets
- the positions used by the ST are composed of a bucket number and the position within the specified bucket

PIF
- alias for a mutable list of pairs of (token, position), where a token is a string and a position is
    a pair of (bucket, rank) denoting the bucket withing the ST hash table and the rank withing the said bucket

Scanner
- operations:
    - scan a file and provide a pair of (SymbolTable, PIF) as output
- implementation:
    - initialized with a token file
        - special case: separators, which are then used for tokenizing each line of the input program
